# Amber Bauer Portfolio 

## Description 

For this project, I got to build a website using html and css to showcase my work. We were presented with a reference image and used as a layout guide but were allowed to explore fonts, images and colors. As a graphic designer this was a project I enjoyed the design freedom that came with it. The biggest struggle I encountered with this project was adapting to using flexbox properties. This excersize allowed me to strengthen that muscle and create a clean, organized layout using flexbox. 

The portfolio has several interactive features including the navigation, work section and contact area. For these sections I used linkable syntaxes to bring the user to an appropriate location. I also implemented media queries so that when the user views the page depending on device they should see a responsive layout.
